# AGL Application Framework

The binder provides a way to connect applications to the services that it
needs.

It provides a fast way to securely offer APIs to applications written in any
language and running almost anywhere.

## Install the AGL application framework

### Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install agl-app-framework-binder-dev
```

```

### Fedora
